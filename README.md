## Tic Tac Toe

  Basic Tic Tac Toe game, achieved using JavaScript, jQuery, and HTML, styled with CSS.

## Plan
  I started this project by sorting out all of the user functions. I was able to get the user to be able to Sign Up to the website, Sign In to the website, change their password when they are signed in, and also Sign Out of the website. After I got all of the user functions working the way they are intended I went on to having only the Sign Up and sign in forms visible and then when the user signs into their account the sign out and change password forms will be visible. Once I had the User functionality figured out I moved onto the Game itself. Using API requests along with JavaScript I was able to program the board to alternate between an X player and an O player as well finding the winner based off of which cells are filled with which player.

  ## User Stories
    1. As a user I want to be able to Sign Up to the website.
    2. As a user I want to be able to sign in with what I signed up with.
    3. As a user I want to be able to change my password if needed.
    4. As a user I want to be able to play Tic Tac Toe and see who wins.
    5. As a user I want to be able to see who's turn it is.
    6. As a user I want to be able to see how many games I have played.
    7. As a user I want to be able to play the game one after another.

  ## Technologies Used
    1. jQuery
    2. HTML/CSS

  ## To be Completed
    The styling is very bland and I would like to style it a bit more.
